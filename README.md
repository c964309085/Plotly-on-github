Dash apps are composed of two parts. The first part is the "layout" of the app and it describes what the application looks like. The second part describes the interactivity of the application and will be covered in the next chapter.

Dash provides Python classes for all of the visual components of the application. We maintain a set of components in the dash_core_components and the dash_html_components library but you can also build your own with JavaScript and React.js.

Note: Throughout this documentation, Python code examples are meant to be saved as files and executed using python app.py. You can also use Jupyter with the JupyterDash library.
